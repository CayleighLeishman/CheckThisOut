 Tools and Concepts Used
CSS Grid & Flexbox for layout

Media Queries for responsive design

BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention

Reusable Components for cleaner structure

Semantic HTML for clarity and accessibility

Custom Code Styling for learning emphasis

## How I’m Using It
Each topic page includes:

A friendly explanation of the concept

Visual structure using .post, .article, and .grey-box

Code examples styled for readability

Notes written in my own words to reinforce understanding

##  What I’ve Learned So Far
- How to build a reusable layout system using Grid

- How components make styling and content maintenance easier

- How to apply BEM to stay organized

- How breaking things down clearly helps my future self avoid relearning from scratch

## Future Ideas
Add more topics (e.g., specificity, z-index, animation, etc.)

Create a search or filter feature

Include interactive code examples or demos


##  Final Thoughts
I built Cascade Cayos as a personal CSS reference tool. It's a small project with a big goal: to make learning stick by writing for myself, in my own language, with the structure I need to grow. If I forget something later, I know exactly where to look.
