12:21, I had a few minutes before my tutoring appointment so I decided to check in on the code. I tried to see if i could convert my notes
to .md format, but honesltsy I've gotten the handle of txt. If I do change my mind, I'll give the work to future cayleigh to worry about instead. 

12:37 I ended up just workig on the css for partials.css because I had a hard time thinking about what to do and also the navigation was BUGGING me
so I designed the navigation to be side to side. I'm really impressed and happpy with the work on it. It's not the colors I think I'll stick with
but I like the layout. I also added a hover effect to the links. I think I might add a hover effect to the buttons as well, but I haven't decided
the color yet, so I'm just going to leave it for now and worry about it after the routes work.

Speaking of Routes; both profile and Dashboard are not working. It has some codding errors: 

```console SyntaxError for profile: 
Unexpected token ')' in C:\Users\cayle\Documents\byui\cse-340-project\CheckThisOut\src\views\profile.ejs while compiling ejs

If the above error is not helpful, you may want to try EJS-Lint:

Or, if you meant to create an async function, pass `async: true` as an option.

3/19/25

I'm trying to narrow down what I have to do, but I am not feeling very good, so I'm going to take a look around and see what I can do.

So I ran the server js "pnpm dev" in terminal and noticed a bunch of errors.

i figured dout it was because I moved my CHECKTHISOUT file to a different folder so I reinstalled everything 

i did pnpm install 

It asked if I was okay replacing th enode_modules

I said yes
and it installed and looks like the installation passed

it gave an error in index.js but it was just an extra letter "b" that I have no idea where it came from. 

IT WORKED 
YES 
TAKE THAT 

Nvm I spoke to soon, I opened localHost://3000 and it said:

Okay, I figured out what went wrong:

So when I talekd to the proffessor he suggested that I work on the getGenres function, but I didn't know where to put it.
So I put it in the utils file, but I think it should be in the src/routes/index.js file. So I moved it there and now it works. (auto cht gave me thiss
so now I'm going to see if it works.)

I got really distracted and started creating a login and logout and created a page for generated quotes when 
a user logs out. I don't think I wrote the path correctly, however, I'm going to leave that for another time. 

I got the routes working for these pages:
login
logout
dashboard (need to add a logout button)
profile


I did a bunch of other stuff along the way like updated the singout generator, added admin folder in models (to create an admin account), 
and added a few other things that I don't quite remember because I got caught up with the code lol. 

I tried to create a generated quote page, but I think I'll put that off till later IF I have time. I have a lot to focus on instead. 

but I'm proud of the progress I've made. 

I created css for the partials because I was getting sick and tired of how big everything was and how disorganized it looked, so i
added css and learned that you actually CAN import css into another css file. I was suprised by that. It dosen't look pretty yet,
but I just wanted it to be functional. 

I created a contacts.css but then realized i could have it in main.css. I might ask the professor when I should consider having different CSS styes
but I'd like to wait till I can get the routes and database working first.I spent enough time on the interactivity. I might take a break 
now and work on it again later tonight if i get the other stuff working, but we'll see. I need to get going on my final project for my classes.
I wont get an A which is disapointing but I know I'm not going to have a lot of streangth to finish this semster strong. I'm in so much pain
and I had a weird episode where I fel tlike i was going to pass out and I kept feeling hot then cold and then having shakes and it hurt my
neck and back pretty intensly and the professor had to get me a cold waterbottle, which I really appreciated but i was still internally 
both freaked out and reallly frusterated. I thought I wass doing fine but the treatment dont feel like're working. So I'm really frusterated. 

anyways back to the code, I thikn there's a lot left to do but im happy with the progress made. 

3/17/25

11:50 
Okay Im giving up, I decided to see if maybe i didn't install everything and it turns out
 I forgot to install express, ejs path (Facepalm.) So I'm installing that now, and we'll 
 if that fixes things, or iff I missed something else (which I''m sure I did.)

okay this installation is taking a while its a little anoying 

its fine, I'm just going to review the code and see what else i could be missing out
besides the installation process.

okay  everyhthing is working but I had a feeling to comment out some code. 
The only reason i had the code was because (I had an error that I can't remmeber entirely rn,) something about the page not loading
I suspected the server.js wasn't connecting to env file so in the server.js I added 
___
server.js:
//To guide .env to postgress
//Because I  got really annoyed and tired of reinstalling and uninstalling postgress (SOO TIMES MAN.)
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();
const myAppPath = process.env.MY_APP_PATH;
const dbUrl = process.env.DB_URL.replace('${MY_APP_PATH}', myAppPath);
console.log(dbUrl); 
___

This I know was to create a variable that would work in .env that would help redirect it to postgres. It had seemed to workwhen 
i in putted it then but now that I installed express path i think that it's now working without it. 
So I reverted the .env file to how i thought it was supposed to be: 
___
.env file before (why i had above code in server.js): 

MY_APP_PATH=C:\Users\cayle\AppData\Local\Programs
DB_URL=postgresql://leishman42622:238242622@143.198.247.195:5432/${MY_APP_PATH} // and i declared the {MY_APP_PATH} in server.js
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
____ 

.env file after (after i deleted the code in server.js and fixed up .env)

MY_APP_PATH=C:\Users\cayle\AppData\Local\Programs
DB_URL=postgresql://leishman42622:238242622@143.198.247.195:5432/C:\Users\cayle\AppData\Local\Programs
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
 
____

after taking this code out nothing seemed to be different, so I'm not entirely sure why it seemed to work when I put it in but 
dont need it now. 

11:15

I noticed in the .env I seemed to have forward and back slashes:
ex:  
DB_URL=postgresql://leishman42622:238242622@143.198.247.195:5432/C:\Users\cayle\AppData\Local\Programs

so I changed it to this: 
DB_URL=postgresql://leishman42622:238242622@143.198.247.195:5432/C:\Users\cayle\AppData\Local\Programs

11:25 wsa editing debugging method to hopefully make sense later down then line if I need to review it and so I could figure 
out what the heck i did the last few minutes. 

I checked the getNav in the utils folder and the get nav is defined. But I can't tell what I'm missing. 
 
 11:28 I'm going to end it here for now because I have some stuff to take care of but this is going to be in th eback of my midn all day

3:50 talked to a  one classmate to check if everything in my dependencies packages and it looks like I have everything in the packages.json file. 
I needed. I also asked a different classmate and he noted that consol.log only shows in the terminal. So thats why i wasn't getting anything (sigh)

so anyways I realized how to make better comments in consol.log. I dont just say what line its on, I say what funciton its in to see if its running. At least one was
running so things are running, just not everything. 






3/16/2025
1:00
just looking over code and reviewing how to work consol.log("print")

I ended up using chat to talk about the databse lol. I need to focus on the routers, so I'm going to close all the files I had up and
try to have  fresh start so I can gauge what I'm missing. Something is not connecting. 
 
So far I've noticed:

i dont have Homeroute in src/routes/index.js but the server is trying to import a HomeRoute. That could be the missing link, a
I'm looking into it now. 

2:13
never mind I misunderstood the code. it runs in the server, but it actually imports (puts in server.js) what was
exported ("pushed out") from src/routes/index.  no bug there, but press on! My battery is low an dI left the charger at 
home in rexburg, but I'm in pocatello. I'll do what I can.



3/15/25

I know this is low priority but I was really annoyed by the lack of logo,
so I added the logo. It's pretty big so I'll have to readjust the size, but I'll worry about that
once I get the routes working. (I added logo in the src/partials/header)

Also before that I did play with the footter just to test things out, and it worked great! the code is conencting
properly

I just need to figure out the routes stuff now

I also used chatgbt to work ont the getNav so that I could have links to get becaus eI was getting stuck but we need a nav 
to navigate to different pages

I created the getNav,and i know its the right place to put it, but its not showing, but I'm going to explore the server.js and see
if i can detemrine what navHtml is set as.

2 hours later 
I figured out that the import in server.js was set as "mport configNodeEnv from './src/middleware/node-env.js'; " but in the 
src/middleware/node-env it was set as configureNodeEnvironemtn." so i did a search for both "configureNodeEnvironement" and "configNodeEnv" through 
all files in visual studio code for tCheckThisOut folder and dint find any other implementations fo the code so I just changed the npde-env.js file to 
represnt whats in the import statement. 

 I checked out consol log and it returned a favicon 404 error so I added in a favicon
  that I just exported to the public/images folder. now the consol log shows no errors 
  but I have consol.log showing so i'm going to double check why I'm not seeing any logs w
  when something should be showing. 

okay so i need to write consol.log() in .js files to see what's running and whats not tomorrow. I really want to keep working on it because I feel like
I'm on a roll, however, i'm also gettign tired and I have church so I'll take care of this after church and just bring my laptop to the family dinner so if I'm not chatty with 
someone I can code. 



3/14/2025

haven't touched it in a couple days, but heres what the professor suggested before I forget

Get URL and routes working. Dont add POSTS (stuff within functions) 
Just write the egining of functions 

once url's are working then worry about getting the db and things set up

after That then work on geting CSS 

4:12 added routes to the src/routes/index.js page.\

added authenticate.js in src/middleware. I'm not sure if that's a good idea but I'll worry about it later.

added 

/*******************************
 *    [focus page]         *
 *******************************/

to hopefully make it easier to read down the line we'll see




3/12/2025

3:25
In class: discussed with the professor different databses I should consider adding to postgress
Some suggestions he made:

book                
    id
    title
    author
    genre (FK from Genre)

users       
    id
    fname
    lname
    email(this will also be their username)

review
    book id (FK)
    user id (fk)
    review (needs to be editable)

role   
    id (fk)
    roles
    
genre   
    id 
    genre (10+, teens, ya, newadult, ect)
    bookid (fk)


checkout
    quantity
    bookid 
    (combine book id and user id? I'll have to clarify with professor)



3/11/25 

12:24am (yes AM I couldn't sleep and was excited about the project.)
I decided to do some more navigating to see what I had in the files-> more specifically the public files. 
I ended up finding pictures I wouldnt need and realized I would need to create a favicon as well. I'll
worry about that down the line and create a "add down the line" section 


anyways i figured for right now I might want a database like the follows

Users           books               genre          staff 
fname                                               role
lname                                               (someone can be both a customer and staff)
birthday
city
address(?)
role

I wanted to keep track of some debugging methods so I could see why soemthing works and something doesnt. Once the
project is done and I'm cmfortable with the outcome, then I'll delete this file. But my goal with this 
is to keep me on track with the errors that keep comming up. 
 
 9:11pm 
I spent a while trying to figure out why it wouldn't work with PostgreSQL. 
I kept getting a 'logged out' message, and eventually realized it wasn't connecting. 
After uninstalling and reinstalling several times, I got frustrated and didn't want to risk it not
 working again. So, I asked ChatGPT for help on how to make the .env file point to a different 
 directory. After adding it to the server.js file, I got it connecting to PostgreSQL 👏

earlier before 9:11pm
I had setting up issues that I cant recall right now, but I know it got resolved. I think it was mainly 
ensuring I had installed everything I needed correctly. 

Goal:                                                 Add down the line
Have one functional page working                    -Favicon 
figure out color scheme                             -
find images for "library" with                      -
genre:                                              -
Fiction                                             -
non fiction                                         -
