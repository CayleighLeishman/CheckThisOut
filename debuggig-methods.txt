i had APP_PAth in .env file so I removed that

I'm going to work on login and flash messages

I'm not sure where to put the validation for passwords so I have it in the public folder for now. Once I get registration and login working I'll see if it should 
be in public or src.

also when i click "click here to register" it says "cannot get reigister" 

I figured out its because I haven't registered the regiester routes in userRoutes yet (Facepalm) at least i know now!

I forgot to add a couple columns so I added

```postgressql
ALTER TABLE user
ADD COLUMN dob DATE,
ADD COLUMN last_login TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN role VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'customer';
"
```

I will add passwords later once I figure out hashing


I GO TTHE REGISTRATION page
TAKE THAT

I DONT REMEMBER THE ISSUE BUT ITS Okay

TO DO :

Fix styling issues in the forms (reigster, login, contacts so forth)
fix response 

I got an error with installing argon2 even though i thought i already had it 
installed. So I'm trying to debug with chat, and it sucggested to reinstall pnpm 

I added: 

```ejs
// meant for authentication to determine if a guest or signed in user is accessing the site
// this middleware is used in the routes that require authentication, ensure this si placedd in the right folder. 

import argon2 from 'argon2';

async function testHashing() {
    const password = 'mysecurepassword';
    
    // Hash the password
    const hashedPassword = await argon2.hash(password);
    console.log('Hashed Password:', hashedPassword);

    // Verify the password
    const isValid = await argon2.verify(hashedPassword, password);
    console.log('Password is valid:', isValid);
}

console.log("src/middleware/authenticate.js")
testHashing();
```
to test if the hashing could work.

now I'm going to update the postgres user table to add passwords


```postgresql
ALTER TABLE "user"
ADD COLUMN hash_pass VARCHAR(255);
```

Done! 

I worked on debugging for authentication and also added this to postgres

```postgres

ALTER TABLE "user"
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email UNIQUE (email);
```
this adds constraight and changes the email to be unique vales so we dont accidetnally have the same email put in multiple times


I'm now working on flash messages, I realized i can out it it as a partial so I'm going to see if i can get that to work


I did a lot to debugg (basically jsut named wrong file for imports)

Also I need to learn the difference between default exports and named exports

So TO DO for me later! 

I'm working on figuring out default exports and how to use it and that there's a correct and wrong way to import them.

Still working on getting logging in rights.

I also realized I have some repeated code so i'm trying to mimimize that. 


added pnpm add express pg body-parser to package.json


Removed professors comment  from models/index/**
 * Instead of connecting to your pool with all the individual settings you can

I forgot to reference this 

[postgres Introduction](https://video.byui.edu/media/t/1_w1w5h9j0)

added to src/models/books-model.js and fixed server.js

I FINALY GOT THE ROUTES GOING FINALLY!!!! BUT I CAN FINALLY CLICK THE link
so anyways thought that works, no matter what routes I use i keep getting learned to
a page that says "logged out" so I'm trying to figure out how its doing that 
and how to fix it.


I also added contact-flash in server.js. I beleive that's the flash that I need to add. 

in routes/index. I realized that I might have the wrong function/paths/names that I need to use.
so I'm going to go through and see if i can fix that.

I fixed updateRole in users-model.js to be updateUserRole and added a way to get the role by id.

I seem to not understand how SESSION_SECRET works, but chatgbt keeps redirecting me there so I'm going to see if i can figure out how to get that going

okay so i figured out it wasn't that, it was because i iwas connected to the database, but wasn't finding any users. (or at least thats my assumptuon)

so i went to postgres and inputted:

```postgresql
CREATE TABLE "user" (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
given_name VARCHAR(275) NOT NULL,
family_name VARCHAR(275) NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(275) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```
it returned:
```comment
CREATE TABLE

Query returned successfully in 110 mseconds (execution time: 0.110 seconds).
```

so now im going to try 

```postgresql
SELECT * FROM "user";
```
it looks like it worked! Obviously i dont have anything in there, but still!

but i just realized I dont have regex implemented, but i'll try to figure that out once I figure out this next step.


HOLY CRAP IT WORKED
I DONT KNOW WHAT I DID BUT IM SO HAPPY 

(I dont see the logged out page anymore, I just need to get the stinking database to show) 

/register is not sending proeperly so I need to figure out why "register" page is not loading. I think its a routes issue 
so I'm going to go through and see if I can figure out where its from. 


I'm a little nervous to push to github just in case there's a different error thats hidden, but while the website is still functional 
I'm gonna do it

to the postgresql I added:

```postgresql
CREATE TABLE genre (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    genre_name VARCHAR(175) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
```
```postgresql
-- Insert default genres
INSERT INTO genre (genre_name) VALUES ('fiction'), ('nonfiction');
```

I realized that I actually named the stuff in the code "name" instead of "genre_name" so I went and tried to fix that in genre-models.js 

I also added the REVIEWS table to the databsae. I dont have a models for it yet but I'll take care of that later. 

```REview postgresql
CREATE TABLE review (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id INT REFERENCES book(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    review TEXT
);

```

CREATE TABLE book (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(275) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(275) NOT NULL,
    genre_id INT REFERENCES genre(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);


I realized it wasn't like my CREATE TABLE in books-model.js so I went and updated it to be like that.

but then i realized i could just DROP the table since htere's nothing in it yet, so I did that instead and used the proper code for it
```postgresql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS book;

```

```postgresql for roles


       CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "roles"(
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id), 
        role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
        description TEXT,
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
```



I didnt put all the sql codes I used, but I GOT SIX OF THEM IN TAKE THAT.

tomorrow I'll activly put things in. Right now the genre's are the only table with something in it. 


4/03/2025 

Today was a very stressful day and while i got a lot of personal things taken care of, this assingmnet is still not where 
i hoped it would be. After reviewing the requirements i'm feelin a little bit better, but i'm still feeling lost on 
Postgress and how to get it ont he frontend. More so how to use postgres. 

The good news: W3schools saves the day. 

[Postgres in W3School -opens in a new tab](https://www.w3schools.com/postgresql/postgresql_pgadmin4.php)

[Kindson The Tech Pro -Youtube opens in a new tab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n-Ai30C1qs)

I'm going to see what else i can get done tomorrow because I'm barelyawake



4/03/2025

bcrypt stopped working for me, I'm not sure why it changed, but i unstilalled that package, i messed more with the code 
and even tried to delete node_modules and install it again, but no avail. so Now I'm replacing it with argon2 which 
I'm hoping hoping hoping will help me a lot. 

I even tried  "bcryptjs" but it was a bust. 

I installed arogon2. so we;ll see how that goes. 

My goal wsa to get the frontend connected to the db, but
 chatgbt made a point to recognize that i wasn't using the right postgres connection string. all i need is my
 db name, so i'm going to make sure that that's activly set up properly. but im falling asleep and i started writing 
 sentences that didn't make sense about how chatgbt[ was my pregnant bother (sigh)] I'm too sleepy to be coding.

 I wish i could stay awake, but it is what it s at this point. i'll see if i can get the errors fixed up by the end of tomorrow. 

4/02/2025 

meet with professor to figure out the plan and we talked about these things 

//to do: 
//add books on frontend not in the database of SRC 
// you're missing sessiosn hook that up in server.js

//simplify passwords if bcrypt is hard
//dont use mdfive for pass
//get it running on render 
//on teams there's a link for "force connect with github 
// //new /web service 

he stressed to make sure i was making it so that the database would update when it gets added to the website not manually added in the folders. Only in the frontend 
so I deleted the database folders I created  

I was in so much pain it was hard to code, but I deleted the database, then I  did an 
```installation 
npm install express-session 
```
to install the ability to use sessions, I need to implement it in the servers.js and see what happens 


10:00 pm 

Apparenlty I didn;t install Bcrypt (???) not sure how that happened, but I did 

```install
npm install bcrypt

```

So it should have gone through this time, and then next I'll try to figure out how to make the layouts work properly

i put in secret_Session in the .env file and put in a secret code. i also added a default in the server.js "in_sesions_something_is_wrong" so
if there is an unexpected error where it dosent connect to the env file, then i can tell if i randomly see that unex[ectedly
] i see that that something is wrong and where the issue may be comming from so i can find it. 

each time i try to run it it keeps saying bcrypt is not installed. package.json proved it right so i added it as a dependancies manually and tried to 
npm install again. if that dosent work i need to delete node_modules and try to reinstall it again. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

april 1 2025

10:57pm 

I cant see too well but my blood sugar spiked so this will be a long 30 min

9:30 pm
im struggling to remember most of this project so ill have to talk to the professor. I'm developing a bitof a headache but
I want to try to get something done.

created te roles-models, i dont know if i need to have anything other than the users given_name. I thikn i'll chnage it to their id.

I worked on the 

roles-model.js and added a way to get all roles, add a role, delete a role, and get a role by id.

auth-routes i created


src/routes/index.jsi worked on the posts 


src/utils/auth.js i updaed code format and ai suggetedc i use JWTS but im not sure if thats' why im supposed to use.

i dont know if i need it, but im thinking of a contacts table where when people type messages in contacts, it will upload to the table 
idk if thats the most effective

added getUserByEmail so that i can retreive a ser from the db using their email address


added way for users to see the last time they logged in


I'm not sure what I need in the sql so I'm just going to implement the 

added database folder and in it now we have 

addGenres
AddRoles
and addUsers

i finished what i oculd for addUsers but now going to bed its really late

trjed to push to github but it gave me some errors 

as long as it keeps my changes, i dont care
3/28/2025

BRRROOO okay, I'm going to figure out by the end of the day:

is everything in the right table?

How to add inserts?

WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS STUPID ROUTES things

anyways, everything is fine, but I'm going to figure out genre and see if i got everything there, and then
go work on books

okay I updated some things in genre, such as changingg it to "generes-model" I can't tell if i should do it that way for my own 
sanity or leave it so I'll keave it for now until I see a reason not to. 

anyways, I also updated books, I simplified it so that i could utilize it more easily. 
The only changes I really made was handling missing "PublishedDate" in "addBook" function, and I also 
added a few more comments to clarify what each function does
, especially because I kept forgetting what result.rows[0] vs result.rows did. Result.rows returns all rows,
result.rows[0] returns the first row of the result set. This is tant because when you are inserting a new 
record, you want to return the first row to
 confirm it was added correctly.

I also updated the delete funciton to return a proper message in genera/ 



it go tme thinking about permissions though so here's my plan:

customers: can add to their list what they want to read along with a way to review things.
bonus: if they can have a history to see what books they've added in the past

Staff: can delete and add books to the database, and add books to users account maybe?

Admin: 
They can do everything, esepcially  manage the genres. They can also view all users
 and their reviews, but a comment will be ;eft if admin changes it. 


updated deleteBook as well, I made it so that it didn't have the Finally { 

 especially because I didnt know what it did, so I'm using it like this instead. }

I can't figre out if in my Try Catches if I type error as error or err. I'm seeing both in examples and 
I can't remember out which one is correct for my files and how I had decided to do it beforehand. 
I think it might just be personal preference, but for now, I'm going to stick with "error" because
 I beleive that's what I used in the other functions.

I spent a lot of time workin gon the error handling in the try catches in models/books-models

I realized I ket repeating const message wayyy to much so I decided to create a function that would 
help me limit that typing or repetitivity. 

I did the same to genres as well. 

updated the books-models to have fun messages that were more consistent. I probably shouldn't have spent 
so much time on this (it is now 5:24) but itw as too fun to pass up. 

5:36 I did the same things with users lol

I also used gemeni and I started prepareing permisisons (src/routes/permissions)
 and added files that I beleive will implement their permissions properly. We'll find out!

but  Ihad to make sure to add comments for the imports because I cannot remember how to link the fiels corectly.

like, is it 
../../models/books.js or is it
src/models/books.js or is it
../models/books.js
etc. 

so I'll finish the db tomorrow (fingers crossed) and then I'll work on the permissions after that.
 I also need to add a few more routes for the books and genres, but I want to make sure the database
  is set up first.


  that will be my goal for tomorrow: work on implementing the db and seeing how routes and permissions go! 

  also in src/routes/permissions I did originally name the files admin-permissions but it's long, 
  so I think if its in a subfile I might just leave it as admins.js fand so forth for now.


3/27/2025

4:37 

Im going to just review the inports and see what I can get doen 

I have some thigns to take care of, so I'm going to be done for now, but all I did was add some ways to update and deelte generes table
or at least that was the intent, but i hope im not confusing the concepts from the other tables. I'll have to review it later.

3/26/2025

3L25 

I'm trying to decifer if I need a controllers but I just talked with my classmade and he clarified that the 
routes ARE controllers so I'm going to keep going with that.

the middleware folder is supposed to be for GLOBAL middleware (all of the MVC IS middleware which is why I got confused), 
so I'm going to keep that in mind, that it's supposed to be code that is used for ALL if not MOST pages. So authentication 
dosen't need to be in there, but I'm going to keep it there for now because I'm not sure where else to put it. I'm 
thinking It'll go in the utils folder, but I'm going to play around before commiting to it because for now I KNOW it's in middlware. 

The models are the database information, and views are for what displays on the pages. 

I'm fursterated that I'm not retaining all this intofmation this as well as I hoped, but I appreciate the help from Hyrum (classmate)

I'm now cconfusing myself trying to figure out stuff
heres what I have so far:\

in Utils I added:
auth.js (for authentication to ensure passwords are correct and the righ tpeople have access)
validator.js (to validate passwords, birthdays, etc. I dont know if i need it but I know
 I want to validate so I'm trying to figure out what I need here)


In  src/models:
added books.js
removed passwords from users.js- this is supposed to strictly be stuff added to postgres
imported{ pass_hash } from '../utils/auth.js';

I also learned the views/register is not working properly so I need to figure out why it
 "can't get /register" but that's for another day.

I need to redirect focus onto creating the database and get it so that people can create an account and sign in and out.


11:59pm

i addjusted models/users.js to have correct import (was previously importing from db.js but dont currently have a db.js file)
I also added a genres db

i added code that i think is correct for generes.s but I'll review it tomorrow and determine that later, 
i got a lot of things to catch up on. So far, I'm not detecting any bugs so I'm going to ensure the 
site still runs decently and then push my changes to github.

Also, just wantd to say I love that i can use the logo to click back to the home page. One of My Favourite features of websites.


3/25/2025

I realized I didnt' ahve a controllers so I took to chat to confirm somethigs
chatt didnt work so I used gemii 

it suggested  use npm install bcrypt for password hashing 

so I did npm install bcryppt and then CTRL+C to stop the server and then pnpm dev to restart the server
and then typed it properly and let it download.  Its a library that 
provides password hashing functionality. I probably didt' need it, but wanted to play aroudn with it 
a smidge. 

So anyways that's installing and then I'll check that it installed in package.json 
as well. Then i'll move on to the next step.

I implimented it into the users.js file and 
then I'm going to test it ou... once I get the postgres database going XD

okay i fixed up the models/users.js file, so I added hashing, and updated to add roles. I oroginally was goig 
to have a roles table, but when i used gemeni it made a solid point about adding complexitty so I decided to narrow it down to users 
so I'll create the other database tables later down the line.

so thats what i updated on today. I fixed yup everything so that it had all the proper rows and information
needed in each section. I learned how to navigate placeholders (the $1 $2 $3) and how to use them in the query.
that was pretty cool. not sure how entirely secure it is, but i bet its secure enough for a project like this.


3/24/25

I didnt realiz ehow long its been since I did this, but I'm looking now at trying to figure out the postgresql. I think it's supposed 
to go in the "Models" folder, but I'm not 100% sure. I'm going to try to figure it out now. 

I'm utilizing chatgbt to ensure I understand what I'm putting in usesrs.js. I'm trying to figure out how to organize
and connect my files because I want it to be broken down and simple to read, but i'm not sure how to set it up 100%. 
I do like the idea of breaking each files in models for each table, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to go about it.
I'm going to try it out and see if it works.

I did use chatgbt to help me understand how to set up the users.js file and understand what "pools" is doing. 
 I'm not sure if I'm doing it right, but I'm going to try it out because it seems like it'll be easiest to organize by if I can see 
 what each file is for. 

 I typed in "Import' in server.js then forgot promptly why I did that then went back to work on users.js. 
 I added a way to add users, delete users, validate date of birthday
 added a way to get all users in a table, and get a user by id. I think it's doing something, so we'll find out!



3/21/2025
4:10 
so tody all ive done so far is just provided an progress update, but im hoping to get a lot done this week./ 

4:17 added an about page and a contact page
down the len I might make a page about how it works, but i think i'll put it as a readme later down the line.

I realized i created a signup page when it should have been "register" it probably dosent matter but i wanted to keep 
it consistent


4:34 i used 
```bash
npm install pg dotenv
`
to install the pg and dotenv packages. I also added the dotenv.config() to the server.js file.

I keep getting drastically tired so I'll cime back to this nce I'm more levelheaded. 


3/20/2025


12:21, I had a few minutes before my tutoring appointment so I decided to check in on the code. 
I tried to see if i could convert my notes to .md format, but honesltsy I've gotten the handle of txt. 
If I do change my mind, I'll give the work to future cayleigh to worry about instead. 

12:37 I ended up just workig on the css for partials.css because I had a hard time thinking about what to do 
and also the navigation was BUGGING meso I designed the navigation to be side to side. I'm really impressed and
 happpy with the work on it. It's not the colors I think I'll stick with but I like the layout. 
 I also added a hover effect to the links. I think I might add a hover effect to the buttons as well, but I haven't decided
the color yet, so I'm just going to leave it for now and worry about it after the routes work.

Speaking of Routes; both profile and Dashboard are not working. It has some codding errors:

My ta is ready now so I'm going to be done for now. I'll work on it later tonight. 



3/19/25

I'm trying to narrow down what I have to do, but I am not feeling very good, so I'm going to take a look around and see what I can do.

So I ran the server js "pnpm dev" in terminal and noticed a bunch of errors.

i figured dout it was because I moved my CHECKTHISOUT file to a different folder so I reinstalled everything 

i did pnpm install 

It asked if I was okay replacing th enode_modules

I said yes
and it installed and looks like the installation passed

it gave an error in index.js but it was just an extra letter "b" that I have no idea where it came from. 

IT WORKED 
YES 
TAKE THAT 

Nvm I spoke to soon, I opened localHost://3000 and it said:

Okay, I figured out what went wrong:

So when I talekd to the proffessor he suggested that I work on the getGenres function, but I didn't know where to put it.
So I put it in the utils file, but I think it should be in the src/routes/index.js file. So I moved it there and now it works. (auto cht gave me thiss
so now I'm going to see if it works.)

I got really distracted and started creating a login and logout and created a page for generated quotes when 
a user logs out. I don't think I wrote the path correctly, however, I'm going to leave that for another time. 

I got the routes working for these pages:
login
logout
dashboard (need to add a logout button)
profile


I did a bunch of other stuff along the way like updated the singout generator, added admin folder in models (to create an admin account), 
and added a few other things that I don't quite remember because I got caught up with the code lol. 

I tried to create a generated quote page, but I think I'll put that off till later IF I have time. I have a lot to focus on instead. 

but I'm proud of the progress I've made. 

I created css for the partials because I was getting sick and tired of how big everything was and how disorganized it looked, so i
added css and learned that you actually CAN import css into another css file. I was suprised by that. It dosen't look pretty yet,
but I just wanted it to be functional. 

I created a contacts.css but then realized i could have it in main.css. I might ask the professor when I should consider having different CSS styes
but I'd like to wait till I can get the routes and database working first.I spent enough time on the interactivity. I might take a break 
now and work on it again later tonight if i get the other stuff working, but we'll see. I need to get going on my final project for my classes.
I wont get an A which is disapointing but I know I'm not going to have a lot of streangth to finish this semster strong. I'm in so much pain
and I had a weird episode where I fel tlike i was going to pass out and I kept feeling hot then cold and then having shakes and it hurt my
neck and back pretty intensly and the professor had to get me a cold waterbottle, which I really appreciated but i was still internally 
both freaked out and reallly frusterated. I thought I wass doing fine but the treatment dont feel like're working. So I'm really frusterated. 

anyways back to the code, I thikn there's a lot left to do but im happy with the progress made. 

3/17/25

11:50 
Okay Im giving up, I decided to see if maybe i didn't install everything and it turns out
 I forgot to install express, ejs path (Facepalm.) So I'm installing that now, and we'll 
 if that fixes things, or iff I missed something else (which I''m sure I did.)

okay this installation is taking a while its a little anoying 

its fine, I'm just going to review the code and see what else i could be missing out
besides the installation process.

okay  everyhthing is working but I had a feeling to comment out some code. 
The only reason i had the code was because (I had an error that I can't remmeber entirely rn,) something about the page not loading
I suspected the server.js wasn't connecting to env file so in the server.js I added 
___
server.js:
//To guide .env to postgress
//Because I  got really annoyed and tired of reinstalling and uninstalling postgress (SOO TIMES MAN.)
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();
const myAppPath = process.env.MY_APP_PATH;
const dbUrl = process.env.DB_URL.replace('${MY_APP_PATH}', myAppPath);
console.log(dbUrl); 
___

This I know was to create a variable that would work in .env that would help redirect it to postgres. It had seemed to workwhen 
i in putted it then but now that I installed express path i think that it's now working without it. 
So I reverted the .env file to how i thought it was supposed to be: 
___
.env file before (why i had above code in server.js): 

MY_APP_PATH=C:\Users\cayle\AppData\Local\Programs
DB_URL=postgresql://leishman42622:238242622@143.198.247.195:5432/${MY_APP_PATH} // and i declared the {MY_APP_PATH} in server.js
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
____ 

.env file after (after i deleted the code in server.js and fixed up .env)

MY_APP_PATH=C:\Users\cayle\AppData\Local\Programs
DB_URL=postgresql://leishman42622:238242622@143.198.247.195:5432/C:\Users\cayle\AppData\Local\Programs
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
 
____

after taking this code out nothing seemed to be different, so I'm not entirely sure why it seemed to work when I put it in but 
dont need it now. 

11:15

I noticed in the .env I seemed to have forward and back slashes:
ex:  
DB_URL=postgresql://leishman42622:238242622@143.198.247.195:5432/C:\Users\cayle\AppData\Local\Programs

so I changed it to this: 
DB_URL=postgresql://leishman42622:238242622@143.198.247.195:5432/C:\Users\cayle\AppData\Local\Programs

11:25 wsa editing debugging method to hopefully make sense later down then line if I need to review it and so I could figure 
out what the heck i did the last few minutes. 

I checked the getNav in the utils folder and the get nav is defined. But I can't tell what I'm missing. 
 
 11:28 I'm going to end it here for now because I have some stuff to take care of but this is going to be in th eback of my midn all day

3:50 talked to a  one classmate to check if everything in my dependencies packages and it looks like I have everything in the packages.json file. 
I needed. I also asked a different classmate and he noted that consol.log only shows in the terminal. So thats why i wasn't getting anything (sigh)

so anyways I realized how to make better comments in consol.log. I dont just say what line its on, I say what funciton its in to see if its running. At least one was
running so things are running, just not everything.

just looking over code and reviewing how to work consol.log("print")

I ended up using chat to talk about the databse lol. I need to focus on the routers, so I'm going to close all the files I had up and
try to have  fresh start so I can gauge what I'm missing. Something is not connecting. 
 
So far I've noticed:

i dont have Homeroute in src/routes/index.js but the server is trying to import a HomeRoute. That could be the missing link, a
I'm looking into it now. 

2:13
never mind I misunderstood the code. it runs in the server, but it actually imports (puts in server.js) what was
exported ("pushed out") from src/routes/index.  no bug there, but press on! My battery is low an dI left the charger at 
home in rexburg, but I'm in pocatello. I'll do what I can.



3/15/25

I know this is low priority but I was really annoyed by the lack of logo,
so I added the logo. It's pretty big so I'll have to readjust the size, but I'll worry about that
once I get the routes working. (I added logo in the src/partials/header)

Also before that I did play with the footter just to test things out, and it worked great! the code is conencting
properly

I just need to figure out the routes stuff now

I also used chatgbt to work ont the getNav so that I could have links to get becaus eI was getting stuck but we need a nav 
to navigate to different pages

I created the getNav,and i know its the right place to put it, but its not showing, but I'm going to explore the server.js and see
if i can detemrine what navHtml is set as.

2 hours later 
I figured out that the import in server.js was set as "mport configNodeEnv from './src/middleware/node-env.js'; " but in the 
src/middleware/node-env it was set as configureNodeEnvironemtn." so i did a search for both "configureNodeEnvironement" and "configNodeEnv" through 
all files in visual studio code for tCheckThisOut folder and dint find any other implementations fo the code so I just changed the npde-env.js file to 
represnt whats in the import statement. 

 I checked out consol log and it returned a favicon 404 error so I added in a favicon
  that I just exported to the public/images folder. now the consol log shows no errors 
  but I have consol.log showing so i'm going to double check why I'm not seeing any logs w
  when something should be showing. 

okay so i need to write consol.log() in .js files to see what's running and whats not tomorrow. I really want to keep working on it because I feel like
I'm on a roll, however, i'm also gettign tired and I have church so I'll take care of this after church and just bring my laptop to the family dinner so if I'm not chatty with 
someone I can code. 



3/14/2025

haven't touched it in a couple days, but heres what the professor suggested before I forget

Get URL and routes working. Dont add POSTS (stuff within functions) 
Just write the egining of functions 

once url's are working then worry about getting the db and things set up

after That then work on geting CSS 

4:12 added routes to the src/routes/index.js page.\

added authenticate.js in src/middleware. I'm not sure if that's a good idea but I'll worry about it later.

added 

/*******************************
 *    [focus page]         *
 *******************************/

to hopefully make it easier to read down the line we'll see

In class: discussed with the professor different databses I should consider adding to postgress
Some suggestions he made:

book                
    id
    title
    author
    genre (FK from Genre)

users       
    id
    fname
    lname
    email(this will also be their username)

review
    book id (FK)
    user id (fk)
    review (needs to be editable)

role   
    id (fk)
    roles
    
genre   
    id 
    genre (10+, teens, ya, newadult, ect)
    bookid (fk)


checkout
    quantity
    bookid 
    (combine book id and user id? I'll have to clarify with professor)



3/11/25 

12:24am (yes AM I couldn't sleep and was excited about the project.)
I decided to do some more navigating to see what I had in the files-> more specifically the public files. 
I ended up finding pictures I wouldnt need and realized I would need to create a favicon as well. I'll
worry about that down the line and create a "add down the line" section 


anyways i figured for right now I might want a database like the follows

Users           books               genre          staff 
fname          title                                  role
lname                                               (someone can be both a customer and staff)
birthday
city
address(?)
role (fk from staff)

I wanted to keep track of some debugging methods so I could see why soemthing works and something doesnt. Once the
project is done and I'm cmfortable with the outcome, then I'll delete this file. But my goal with this 
is to keep me on track with the errors that keep comming up. 
 
 9:11pm 
I spent a while trying to figure out why it wouldn't work with PostgreSQL. 
I kept getting a 'logged out' message, and eventually realized it wasn't connecting. 
After uninstalling and reinstalling several times, I got frustrated and didn't want to risk it not
 working again. So, I asked ChatGPT for help on how to make the .env file point to a different 
 directory. After adding it to the server.js file, I got it connecting to PostgreSQL 👏

earlier before 9:11pm
I had setting up issues that I cant recall right now, but I know it got resolved. I think it was mainly 
ensuring I had installed everything I needed correctly. 

Goal:                                                 Add down the line
Have one functional page working                    -Favicon 
figure out color scheme                             -
find images for "library" with                      -
genre:                                              -
Fiction                                             -
non fiction                                         -
YA                                                  -
Children                                            -
