12:24am (yes AM I couldn't sleep and was excited about the project.)
I decided to do some more navigating to see what I had in the files-> more specifically the public files. 
I ended up finding pictures I wouldnt need and realized I would need to create a favicon as well. I'll
worry about that down the line and create a "add down the line" section 


anyways i figured for right now I might want a database like the follows

Users           books               genre          staff 
fname                                               role
lname                                               (someone can be both a customer and staff)
birthday
city
address(?)
role

I wanted to keep track of some debugging methods so I could see why soemthing works and something doesnt. Once the
project is done and I'm cmfortable with the outcome, then I'll delete this file. But my goal with this 
is to keep me on track with the errors that keep comming up.

I spent a while trying to figure out why it wouldn't work with PostgreSQL. 
I kept getting a 'logged out' message, and eventually realized it wasn't connecting. 
After uninstalling and reinstalling several times, I got frustrated and didn't want to risk it not
 working again. So, I asked ChatGPT for help on how to make the .env file point to a different 
 directory. After adding it to the server.js file, I got it connecting to PostgreSQL üëè

earlier before 9:11pm
I had setting up issues that I cant recall right now, but I know it got resolved. I think it was mainly 
ensuring I had installed everything I needed correctly. 

Goal:                                                 Add down the line
