I know this is low priority but I was really annoyed by the lack of logo,
so I added the logo. It's pretty big so I'll have to readjust the size, but I'll worry about that
once I get the routes working. (I added logo in the src/partials/header)

Also before that I did play with the footter just to test things out, and it worked great! the code is conencting
properly

I just need to figure out the routes stuff now

I also used chatgbt to work ont the getNav so that I could have links to get becaus eI was getting stuck but we need a nav 
to navigate to different pages

I created the getNav,and i know its the right place to put it, but its not showing, but I'm going to explore the server.js and see
if i can detemrine what navHtml is set as.

2 hours later 
I figured out that the import in server.js was set as "mport configNodeEnv from './src/middleware/node-env.js'; " but in the 
src/middleware/node-env it was set as configureNodeEnvironemtn." so i did a search for both "configureNodeEnvironement" and "configNodeEnv" through 
all files in visual studio code for tCheckThisOut folder and dint find any other implementations fo the code so I just changed the npde-env.js file to 
represnt whats in the import statement. 

 I checked out consol log and it returned a favicon 404 error so I added in a favicon
  that I just exported to the public/images folder. now the consol log shows no errors 
  but I have consol.log showing so i'm going to double check why I'm not seeing any logs w
  when something should be showing. 

okay so i need to write consol.log() in .js files to see what's running and whats not tomorrow. I really want to keep working on it because I feel like
I'm on a roll, however, i'm also gettign tired and I have church so I'll take care of this after church and just bring my laptop to the family dinner so if I'm not chatty with 
someone I can code.

haven't touched it in a couple days, but heres what the professor suggested before I forget

Get URL and routes working. Dont add POSTS (stuff within functions) 
Just write the egining of functions 

once url's are working then worry about getting the db and things set up

after That then work on geting CSS 

4:12 added routes to the src/routes/index.js page.\

added authenticate.js in src/middleware. I'm not sure if that's a good idea but I'll worry about it later.

added 

/*******************************
 *    [focus page]         *
 *******************************/

to hopefully make it easier to read down the line we'll see

In class: discussed with the professor different databses I should consider adding to postgress
Some suggestions he made:

book                
    id
    title
    author
    genre (FK from Genre)

users       
    id
    fname
    lname
    email(this will also be their username)

review
    book id (FK)
    user id (fk)
    review (needs to be editable)

role   
    id (fk)
    roles
    
genre   
    id 
    genre (10+, teens, ya, newadult, ect)
    bookid (fk)


checkout
    quantity
    bookid 
    (combine book id and user id? I'll have to clarify with professor)

12:24am (yes AM I couldn't sleep and was excited about the project.)
I decided to do some more navigating to see what I had in the files-> more specifically the public files. 
I ended up finding pictures I wouldnt need and realized I would need to create a favicon as well. I'll
worry about that down the line and create a "add down the line" section 


anyways i figured for right now I might want a database like the follows

Users           books               genre          staff 
fname                                               role
lname                                               (someone can be both a customer and staff)
birthday
city
address(?)
role

I wanted to keep track of some debugging methods so I could see why soemthing works and something doesnt. Once the
project is done and I'm cmfortable with the outcome, then I'll delete this file. But my goal with this 
is to keep me on track with the errors that keep comming up. 
 
 9:11pm 
I spent a while trying to figure out why it wouldn't work with PostgreSQL. 
I kept getting a 'logged out' message, and eventually realized it wasn't connecting. 
After uninstalling and reinstalling several times, I got frustrated and didn't want to risk it not
 working again. So, I asked ChatGPT for help on how to make the .env file point to a different 
 directory. After adding it to the server.js file, I got it connecting to PostgreSQL üëè

earlier before 9:11pm
I had setting up issues that I cant recall right now, but I know it got resolved. I think it was mainly 
ensuring I had installed everything I needed correctly. 

Goal:                                                 Add down the line
Have one functional page working                    -Favicon 
figure out color scheme                             -
find images for "library" with                      -
genre:                                              -
Fiction                                             -
non fiction                                         -
YA                                                  -
Children                                            -
